Machine learning in real life is hard. Finding your way into all the methods and tools is not easy.
Here you will find some resources that inspired me recently to do unit tests for data and productionalize models.

# [Automating Large-Scale Data Quality Verification](https://www.amazon.science/publications/automating-large-scale-data-quality-verification)

It's the paper behind Deequ, a library to do unit tests for data. It's very instructive.
You will see how the tool was thought. I didn't know that it was possible to profile your data to help you decide the tests you want to launch. Very good to know.

# [Data + AI Summit](https://databricks.com/dataaisummit/europe-2020)

Key takeaways:

- Spark has become a platform used by Python (47%) and SQL (41%) users essentially. Many new recent functionalities for Python users: Koalas, UDF with pandas, etc.

- Companies struggle to deploy and maintain notebooks and prefer using Python modules instead. They sometimes use a mix of notebooks and Python modules or only Python modules.

- Realising the difficulties companies have with productionizing notebooks, Databricks decided to launch a new DataScience workspace with better integration with Git, CI/CD, and security. It will be launched in January.

- SQL analytics based on Redash is a new way to do dashboards based on SQL queries. It will be launched soon.

- DeltaLake is the standard for lakehouse (the best of data lakes and data warehouses) when youâ€™re looking for reliability with ACID transactions, performance, governance, and data quality checks (work in progress).

- MLFlow is becoming an essential part of many architectures to deploy safely and to be able to reproduce previous runs. New functionalities are coming: better integration with data versioning with DeltaLake, integration with SHAP to do interpretability.

Last week, I published a quick introduction to *Model drift*.
