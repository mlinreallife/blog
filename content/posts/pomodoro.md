Pomodoro might be an overrated technique. And yet, I can't help thinking it might be a good idea to talk about that. I would like to share my point of view and the way I work with this method. Let's go.

# What is Pomodoro?
Pomodoro is a technique that helps you to stay focus. The steps are:

1. Set a timer of 25 minutes.
2. Work until the bell rings.
3. Take a short break (3 to 5 minutes)
4. Repeat

After 4 iterations, take a longer break (15 to 30 minutes).

# How does it work for me?

## I define the goals of the task before starting it
I don't start a task without defining its goals. I write these goals.
I try to choose reasonable objectives to achieve.

If I didn't finish at the end of the iteration, I continue these goals for the next one.
If I finished earlier, I start another task even if I didn't write it.

I enjoy writing the purposes of my next iteration to give me a target to reach. I want it to be a booster, not a blocker. This is why I don't want to make the defined goals an absolute and fixed obligation. 

## I accept multi-tasking and declare it officially
Multi-taking is not always a bad thing. If you mix a brainless task such as running several times a big job with different parameters and another task such as coding, I don't see the problem. More than that, in this case, multi-tasking is helpful.

When I define the goals of my next step, if I plan to make multi-tasking, I write it this way:
Running jobs + coding this

## I accept interruptions from my coworkers
Many people see Pomodoro as a way to avoid interruptions from colleagues. This is not my goal. As a member of a team that wants to progress together, I don't fear questions from my coworkers. I don't see them as an obstacle. Sometimes, I prefer booking a dedicated meeting to take time thinking about the raised issue. Most of the time, I'm open to disconnections.

Once again, the written goals are supposed to be a booster, not a blocker, not an absolute target to reach.

## I use an online tool
I used to write my objectives manually and set the timer with my mobile phone.

Now, I prefer using an [online tool](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/). 

# Why do I like Pomodoro?

Sometimes, when I have to deal with a piece of work, I'm fearful. I don't know how to start. I wonder if I will be able to achieve it one day. Do I have the ability to find a solution to this tricky problem? Sometimes, I'm so scared that I prefer doing anything else than what I'm required to do.

Pomodoro alleviates my anxiety and helps me to stay focus. Yes, I still have to give efforts but it's much easier. I say to me: do your job for 25 minutes, then you're free. After some iterations, things become to be smooth. And very often, at this moment, I stop doing Pomodoro. I don't need it anymore. I'm focused on my mission and ready to complete it. 

This is why I like this tool.
