A quick article to explain the difference between two relatively new concepts: MLOps and DataOps.

# DataOps
> DataOps is an automated, process-oriented methodology, used by analytic and data teams, to improve the quality and reduce the cycle time of data analytics. (Wikipedia)

## What is inside?

- Methods from DevOps
- Deployment of data pipelines such as data extraction and data transformation
- Monitoring for data pipelines

## Target
Data teams such as data analytics and data engineering teams.

## Keywords

- Data
- Pipeline
- DevOps
- Deployment
- Monitoring

# MLOps

> MLOps (a compound of “machine learning” and “operations”) is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production ML [...] lifecycle. (Wikipedia)

## What is inside?

- Methods from DevOps
- Deployment of machine learning models
- Monitoring of machine learning models
- Reproducibility of machine learning models
- Scalability of machine learning models

## Target
- Data scientists with data engineers, operational workers and business teams

## Keywords
- Machine learning
- Data science
- Deployment
- Monitoring
- DevOps

# Conclusion

In summary, *DataOps* is for deploying and monitoring data pipelines. 

*MLOps* is for deploying and monitoring machine learning models. 

You can have *DataOps* without *MLOps* because you can have data extraction and transformation without machine learning. The contrary is rarely true.
